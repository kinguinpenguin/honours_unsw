abstract = {"Ideas, like individuals and nations, have histories, and so do the research enterprises that sometimes stem from ideas. The history of the research that is reported in the following pages is mainly one of indebtedness. The 34 men who, week after week, faithfully provided the bricks of information out of which this monograph is constructed were, of course, my principal benefactors. Not one of them ever lapsed, for even a single week, and my debt to them is most inadequately repaid by sending each of them a standard model of this monograph. The writing of a research report, too, has its own history, and in the writing of this one I came to the conclusion that it would be a bare-boned research report, together with only such theoretical connective tissue as in fact inspired the initial planning of the research. The reader will find that I have sometimes oscillated between the reporting of tests of theoretically derived prediction and the presenting of exploratory findings. Insofar as the latter are interesting or significant, I have no apology to make for them--especially as one who has often criticized students who, in their eagerness to find support for cherished hypotheses, ignore serendipidous findings. The phenomena of getting acquainted, like most others which one studies intimately for a period of years, are full of interesting surprises, and none of us is capable of anticipating all of them"--Preface.

               in 40 positive and negative social networks",
  author    = "McMillan, Cassie and Felmlee, Diane and Ashford, James R",
  abstract  = "While most social network research focuses on positive
               relational ties, such as friendship and information exchange,
               scholars are beginning to examine the dark side of human
               interaction, where negative connections represent different
               forms of interpersonal conflict, intolerance, and abuse. Despite
               this recent work, the extent to which positive and negative
               social network structure differs remains unclear. The current
               project considers whether a network's small-scale, structural
               patterns of reciprocity, transitivity, and skew, or its
               ``structural signature,'' can distinguish positive versus
               negative links. Using exponential random graph models (ERGMs),
               we examine these differences across a sample of twenty distinct,
               negative networks and generate comparisons with a related set of
               twenty positive graphs. Relational ties represent multiple types
               of interaction such as like versus dislike in groups of adults,
               friendship versus cyberaggression among adolescents, and
               agreements versus disputes in online interaction. We find that
               both positive and negative networks contain more reciprocated
               dyads than expected by random chance. At the same time, patterns
               of transitivity define positive but not negative graphs, and
               negative networks tend to exhibit heavily skewed degree
               distributions. Given the unique structural signatures of many
               negative graphs, our results highlight the need for further
               theoretical and empirical research on the patterns of harmful
               interaction.",
